# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** A researcher can `from pxts import *` and confidently load, manipulate, and visualize financial time series — with no hidden bugs and no surprises.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Test Suite

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Test Suite)
Plan: 1 of ? in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-15 — Plan 01-01 complete: pytest infrastructure (tests/__init__.py, conftest.py fixtures)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 2 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-test-suite | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2 min)
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Warn on ambiguous date format rather than error — backward-compatible, silent corruption is worse
- [Init]: Unit tests per module — fast feedback, isolated failures, clear ownership
- [Init]: CSV-only for v0.1, Parquet deferred to v0.2
- [01-01]: Session scope for ts_df and bad_df — read-only fixtures safe to share across session, avoid redundant construction
- [01-01]: No pxts imports in conftest.py — prevents side-effects during fixture collection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 test infrastructure in place; remaining test modules (01-02 through 01-05) needed before Phase 2 bug fixes can be verified
- `adjustText` is undeclared and graceful fallback is silent — must be addressed in Phase 2
